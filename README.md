# Font-Size-Stylesheet
Bootstrap 5 compatible stylesheet that provides the ability to resize text across the different bootstrap breakpoints.

# Example
The following html:

    <h1 class="fs-10px fs-sm-20px fs-md-30px"> Test Text </h1>

Will have:

10px font size for extra small screens

20px font size on small screens

And finally 30px font size on medium screens and larger.

With these styles as the screen is resized you can responsively control the font size of text.

(Yes this could probably be simplified and perhaps better integrated with bootstrap if this was implemented in Sass)
