# Font-Size-Stylesheet
Bootstrap 5 compatible stylesheet that gives the ability to responsively resize text as screen size changes.

# Example
The following markup:

<h1 class="fs-10px fs-sm-20px fs-md-30px fs-lg-40px fs-xl-50px fs-xxl-60px">

Will have:
10px font size for extra small screens

20px font size on small screens

30px font size on medium screens... etc.

As the screen is resized - you can responsively control the font size of text.

(Yes this could probably be simplified and perhaps better integrated with bootstrap if this was implemented in Sass)
